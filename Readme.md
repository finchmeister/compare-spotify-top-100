# Compare Spotify Top 100 Playlists

I didn't build this to change the world, I built this because I didn't get the 'your year in music' email from
            Spotify. I wanted to know what my year in music was and how it had changed from last year's. If they weren't going
            to tell me, I was going to find out myself - now you can, too.
